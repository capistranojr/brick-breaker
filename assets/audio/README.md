# Audio Files

This folder contains the sound effects for the Neon Brick Breaker game.

Since we can't directly upload audio files through this interface, you'll need to add your own sound files here.

Recommended sound files to add:
- `paddle_hit.mp3` - Sound when the ball hits the paddle
- `brick_hit.mp3` - Sound when the ball hits a brick
- `brick_break.mp3` - Sound when a brick breaks
- `wall_hit.mp3` - Sound when the ball hits a wall
- `powerup_collect.mp3` - Sound when a powerup is collected
- `game_over.mp3` - Sound when the game is over
