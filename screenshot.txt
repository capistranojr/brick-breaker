Note: This is a placeholder for a screenshot.

To add a screenshot to your README:
1. Play the game
2. Take a screenshot of the gameplay (using PrtScn key or Windows+Shift+S)
3. Save the screenshot as "screenshot.png" in the root directory of the project
4. Delete this text file

The screenshot will then appear in your README when viewed on GitHub or other Markdown viewers.
